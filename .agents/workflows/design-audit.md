# Design Audit

Analyze:

- Token violations
- Inconsistent spacing
- Accent overuse
- Glass misuse
- Accessibility violations
- Layout shifts
- Responsiveness issues
- Use shadn cn ui for most of the part.
- If something that can is not aviable on shadcn ui then create custom component but follow the current shdacn ui design sytle must. So that if the gloabal.css file changed based on it the full design will be chaged.

Suggest corrections.
