# Visual Consistency Rule

The DAW must feel:

- Professional
- Minimal
- Focused
- Low visual noise
- Subtle glassmorphism

Rules:

- Use soft glass panels only where defined
- No heavy blur stacking
- Avoid strong shadows
- Use subtle elevation differences
- Use consistent 8px spacing scale
- No inconsistent padding

Accent usage:
- Accent gradient only for primary actions
- Never overuse accent colors
